VOTING INSTRUCTIONS

If you fail to follow the instructions below your ballot paper may
be ruled invalid. This means your vote will not be counted.

1) One person, one vote.

2) No two voters may vote from the same email address.
   In the event that only one address is available to two persons
   who both wish to vote, both these persons should contact the 
   votetaker prior to voting.

3) Votes must be emailed directly from the voter to the address
   specified by the votetaker.
 
4) There may be technical reasons, such as breaks in the email
   headers of your ballot, which may mean that the votetaker is
   unable to confirm the validity of your vote. The votetaker
   will contact you if there are any irregularities.

If you have followed the voting instructions correctly, you will
receive an acknowledgement of your vote within five days from the
votetaker.
This does not always mean that your vote is valid. The votetaker
will contact you if there is a problem with your vote.

If you do not receive an acknowledgement of receipt of your ballot
paper within five days you should contact the votetaker.

If the acknowledgement "bounces" back to the votetaker (the mail
containing the acknowledgment is returned as undeliverable by a
mailserver), your vote will not be counted. 

It is your responsibility to ensure that your ballot paper has been
received by checking that the acknowledgement arrives. You should
also check that your vote is recorded correctly in the
acknowledgement. If there are any problems with your
acknowledgement, you should contact the votetaker.

===================================================================

BX HOW TO VOTE
BX 
BX Please read the instructions carefully.
BX 
BX The email address that will be published in the results is the one
BX that the ballot paper was sent to. So for example if a ballot paper
BX was sent to example-voter@ukvoting.org.uk, this would be the
BX address shown in the result. This address has to be valid,
BX otherwise you will not receive a ballot paper.
BX 
BX To receive a ballot paper, you must send an email to the Ballot
BX Request Address, which is [votename]@request.ukvoting.org.uk
BX <URL:mailto:[votename]@request.ukvoting.org.uk>.
BX For most news-reading software, just replying by email to this post
BX will address your email correctly, but *please check* that the
BX address above is actually in the To field before you send the mail.
BX 
BX We recognise that sometimes people submit their votes from
BX different addresses for varying reasons, especially when more than
BX one email address is available to a voter. If you want the results
BX to record your vote as coming from a different address to that
BX from which you post your request, you can do this by putting the
BX address you want recorded in the Reply-To field in your ballot
BX request. If you do not know how to do this, or if you are unable
BX for whatever reason, then put the address you want recorded in the
BX Subject line of your ballot request instead.
BX
BX Note: Please remember that you must be able to read email sent to
BX the address you choose to use as your voting address, otherwise you
BX will be unable to retrieve your ballot paper and you will be unable
BX to vote.
BX
BX If you change the Subject field in your email to contain the
BX address you want to use, it doesn't matter whether you also include
BX your name or not, and it doesn't matter whether you enclose your
BX voting address in <angle brackets> or not.
BX
BX It also doesn't matter whether you quote this entire post or
BX delete everything when making your ballot request.
BX 
BX THE REPLY TO YOUR REQUEST
BX 
BX If the autoresponder understands your voting address in the Subject
BX or other fields, it will send a ballot paper immediately to that
BX address. This ballot paper will be personalised and unique to the
BX voting address used.
BX

===================================================================

CASTING YOUR VOTE

BX Your personalised ballot paper will contain a ballot ID and will
BX have your voting address prefilled for your convenience.

CX Your personalised ballot paper is towards the end of this post.
CX Your unique ballot ID and the voting address you have used are
CX prefilled.

Do not change either of these or your vote will not be valid. If
you want to use a different voting address you must request
another ballot paper for the new address.

1) Enter the name under which you want your vote recorded in the  
   results. This must be either your real name or the pseudonym 
   ("handle") which you normally use to post to usenet.

2) Enter the email address which you normally use to post to
   Usenet, including the spamblock if applicable. If you use a
   number of different email addresses, please give the most
   recent, a typical or the most commonly used address. If, and
   only if, you do not post to Usenet, enter the word "none".
   Please do not enter any text in this field other than your
   posting address or the word "none". If you have any doubt as
   to how to complete this section, please contact the votetaker.

   This section is recommended but optional and is to help the
   votetaker verify your vote. If you do not answer this question,
   and the votetaker cannot verify your identity from the other
   information on the ballot, then the votetaker will need to
   carry out further investigations which may include contacting
   you for additional information. If you are unable or unwilling
   to provide such information if requested, your vote might not
   be counted.

3) Mark your voting preferences, as indicated on the ballot
   according to the instructions below.

4) Send your vote.

This vote is being conducted under the [Yes/No / Condorcet / STV
procedure.]

|[Yes/No instructions
|This vote requires a simple 'yes', 'no' response as you wish 
|The letters Y/N may be used if you prefer.]
|
|[Condorcet Instructions
|The ballot consists of multiple options which will be
|counted under the Condorcet system.
|
|To vote, enter '1' against your favourite option, '2'
|against your second favourite option, and so on. 
|
|You may rank options the same if you have no preference
|between them and you may leave options unmarked but are
|requested not to do so. Unmarked options will be assumed
|to be ranked equally, and lower than all marked options.] 
|
|[Single Transferable Vote (STV)
|
|To vote, enter '1' against your favourite candidate, '2'
|against your second favourite candidate, and so on. 
|You may place preferences by as many or as few options as you 
|wish.  Options MUST NOT be ranked equally.]

You may abstain, and have your abstention recorded in the results,
by filling in one or more of the voting boxes [ ] with A or
ABSTAIN. Similarly if you wish to Cancel a vote and have no record
in the results, use C or CANCEL on your ballot paper, and resubmit
it.

[In a multi-part vote you may abstain in any or all parts. If you
abstain in one part and leave all the other parts blank the whole
vote will be treated as an abstain. If you cancel any part the
whole vote will be treated as cancelled.]

You may resubmit your ballot, with different choices, at any time
up to the close of the vote. Your identification details on the 
resubmitted ballot paper must be the same as earlier ones.
Repeat votes will be resolved in favour of the last valid ballot
paper.

The purpose of this vote is to determine the genuine interest of
persons who:

[would read the proposed newsgroup]
[read the newsgroup or would read it if modified]
[have an interest in hierarchy placement]
[have an interest in the effect on existing groups]
[have an interest in changes in the guidelines]
[have an interest in the people who represent them on the Committee]

Soliciting votes from disinterested parties defeats this purpose. 
Under no circumstances should you post your completed ballot paper
to any Usenet/Net News newsgroup or other forum.

If you ignore any of these instructions, your vote may be rejected
as invalid. This includes, but is not limited to, any false answers
given on the ballot paper or any attempt to circumvent the "one
person, one vote" rule or to conceal your identity.

===================================================================

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF RECEIPT OF YOUR BALLOT PAPER

The votetaker will send you an acknowledgement so that you know
that your ballot paper has been received. This may take up to five
days.
If you have not received such an acknowledgement after five days,
then contact the votetaker directly at the Votetaker's Address 
[<votetakeraddress>] 
<URL:mailto:<votetakeraddress>]

An acknowledgement does not necessarily mean that your vote will be
counted.

===================================================================

VOTE VALIDATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY

The acknowledgement which you receive (see above) will contain
details of how you voted. Check this acknowledgement carefully. If
there are any problems, or you did not vote then contact the
votetaker straight away.

During or at the end of the vote, the votetaker will validate every
vote submitted, and the votetaker may need to contact you
concerning any problem or query. You must assist the votetaker's
reasonable efforts to clarify any problem or query with regard to
your vote otherwise your vote may not be counted. Any communication
between the votetaker and yourself must not be considered to be
confidential and the votetaker reserves the right to publish any
information that the votetaker deems relevant to the vote
within the results post.

===================================================================

RESULTS

The names, addresses and vote preferences of all valid and invalid
votes will be published in the results, which are posted to

being harvested by spammers.

be able to see what your preferences were.]
