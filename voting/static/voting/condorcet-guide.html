<h1>CONDORCET COUNTING FOR UK.*</h1>
<p>(version 1.0, Chris M. Dickson, 14/4/99)</p>
<h2>1) INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>When somebody casts a vote in a simple yes/no vote, such as whether or not to
create a newsgroup, they have three choices as to how to cast their vote. If
they prefer &quot;yes&quot; to &quot;no&quot;, they vote for &quot;yes&quot;. If
they prefer &quot;no&quot; to &quot;yes&quot;, they vote for &quot;no&quot;. If
they have no preference between the two, they vote &quot;abstain&quot;. When
someone votes in a Condorcet-counted vote, they are doing essentially the same
task, expressing preference for some options over other options.</p>
<h2>2) CFV DESIGN</h2>
<p>I think it is likely that most uk.* Condorcet-counted votes will come when
there is one newsgroup to be created with one of two possible names, or two
alternative suggestions to change an existent charter or guideline. In either
circumstance, we must also provide an option to preserve the Status Quo; also,
we must provide an option to Re-Open the Discussion, but in only the first two
votes on any one proposal. Condorcet, Status Quo and two Discussion Re-Openings
were all mandated by Paul Bolchover's voting procedures guideline change CFV of
April '98. Thus it is usual that a Condorcet-counted ballot paper will look like
this.</p>
<pre>======================= Start of Ballot XXX01 ======================

Your real name: [ Fill in your name between the brackets ]
Your e-mail address: [ Fill.in@your.address.between.the.brackets ]

*PLEASE COMPLETE THE ABOVE SECTIONS FOR VOTE TO BE VALID.*

Please rank your preferences below:

Option A : [ ]
Option B : [ ]
Status Quo (create neither group): [ ]
Re-Open Discussion: [ ]

======================== End of Ballot XXX01 =======================</pre>
<p>Should there be more options to choose from, they would go between Option B
and Status Quo.</p>
<p>Immediately before the ballot paper, you should include this text, which
seems to have been accepted as the usual description of &quot;how to vote&quot;.</p>
<p>---start quote---</p>
<pre>This vote is being counted under the Condorcet system. Voters are required to
mark a 1 by their favourite option, a 2 by their second favourite option and so
forth. Voters are permitted to mark the same number by more than one option when
they are indifferent between them.

Voters are permitted to leave options unmarked, but are requested not to; the
voter is assumed to show indifference between unmarked options, but to prefer
all the marked options to all the unmarked options. To abstain from the vote,
fill in your name and e-mail address only, leaving all four options unmarked.</pre>
<p>---end quote---</p>
<h2>3) RESULTS INTERPRETATION</h2>
<p>As a result, you will get people filling the four (or more) boxes with
digits. If they fill in the boxes like this:</p>
<pre>Option A : [2]
Option B : [1]
Status Quo (create neither group): [4]
Re-Open Discussion: [3]</pre>
<p>then they are expressing six preferences:</p>
<ol>
<li>Prefer Option B to Option A</li>
<li>Prefer Option B to Status Quo</li>
<li>Prefer Option B to Re-Open Discussion</li>
<li>Prefer Option A to Status Quo</li>
<li>Prefer Option B to Re-Open Discussion</li>
<li>Prefer Re-Open Discussion to Status Quo.</li></ol>
<p>A Condorcet count is little more than six simultaneous yes/no votes on those
six issues. An alternative way to fill the boxes might be:</p>
<pre>Option A : [ ]
Option B : [ ]
Status Quo (create neither group): [1]
Re-Open Discussion: [1]</pre>
<p>which expresses the following six statements:</p>
<ol>
<li>1) Prefer Status Quo to Option A</li>
<li>2) Prefer Status Quo to Option B</li>
<li>3) No preference between Status Quo and Re-Open Discussion</li>
<li>4) Prefer Re-Open Discussion to Option A</li>
<li>5) Prefer Re-Open Discussion to Option B</li>
<li>6) No preference between Option A and Option B.</li></ol>
<p>Incidentally, there's no difference between</p>
<pre>Option A : [ ]
Option B : [ ]
Status Quo (create neither group): [1]
Re-Open Discussion: [1]</pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre>Option A : [2]
Option B : [2]
Status Quo (create neither group): [1]
Re-Open Discussion: [1]</pre>
<p>or</p>
<pre>Option A : [3]
Option B : [3]
Status Quo (create neither group): [1]
Re-Open Discussion: [1]</pre>
<p>or even</p>
<pre>Option A : [4]
Option B : [4]
Status Quo (create neither group): [1]
Re-Open Discussion: [1]</pre>
<p>which all express the same six statements. Boxes left blank are equivalent to
boxes filled in with the number of boxes there are to fill in; that is, boxes
left blank are all equal last place.</p>
<h2>4) COUNTING</h2>
<p>Once all the votes have come in, you can draw up a chart of voters and votes
which might look like this:</p>
<table><tr><th>Name</th><th>A</th><th>B</th><th>S</th><th>R</th></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Jones</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Smith</td><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Brown</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>2</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Green</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter White</td><td>X</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Black</td><td>1</td><td>3</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Robinson</td><td>-</td><td>-</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr></table>
<p>...and so on...</p>
<p>The counting is done in two stages: the first compares each of the options to
the Status Quo and determines which options go on to the second stage.</p>
<p>The general counting technique that you need to master is how to convert a
chart like the one above into a set of statements that one option beats another
option by a number of votes.</p>
<h2>5) COUNTING STAGE ONE</h2>
<p>Concentrate on one pair of options at a time; in the first stage, you will
compare each of the options, apart from Status Quo, against Status Quo. In this
case, you will compare Option A against Status Quo, then Option B against Status
Quo and finally Re-Open Discussion against Status Quo. We shall deal with the
first of these only.</p>
<p>What you need to do is ignore the rest of the chart apart from the columns
containing the options you're comparing. In this case, your chart would look
like</p>
<table><tr><th>Name</th><th>A</th><th>S</th></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Jones</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Smith</td><td>2</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Brown</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Green</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter White</td><td>X</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Black</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Robinson</td><td>-</td><td>1</td></tr></table>
<p>...and so on...</p>
<p>In Jones' case, he's expressing a higher preference for A than for the Status
Quo, so this is a vote for A and against Status Quo. Ditto Smith and Brown.
Green and Robinson express a higher preference for the Status Quo than for
Option A, so this is a vote for Status Quo and against Option A. White just put
a cross against one option and left all the others blank; this is clearly a vote
for Status Quo and a vote against the rest. Black expressed no preference
between Option A and Status Quo, so this is an abstention between the two.</p>
<p>Once you've gone down the list, you'll have a statement that some number of
people (say 38) prefer Option A to the Status Quo, and some other number of
people (say 21) prefer the Status Quo to Option A. Do check the list going up
from the bottom to the top as well as down from the top to the bottom. (I tend
to split the list into groups of ten and fifteen then add the numbers of
preferences in each group up to come to a final total, simply because it is easy
to get confused.) This result can be treated just like the result of a simple
yes/no newsgroup creation vote: if an option beats the Status Quo by at least 12
votes, it succeeds; if it doesn't beat the Status Quo by 12 or more votes, it
fails.</p>
<p>Work this out for each of the options apart from Status Quo, because
comparing Status Quo against Status Quo makes no sense.</p>
<p>If no options beat Status Quo by 12 or more votes, then the Status Quo
prevails and Stage Two is not necessary.</p>
<p>If exactly one option beats Status Quo by 12 or more votes, then it is the
winner and Stage Two is not necessary.</p>
<p>If two or more options beat Status Quo by 12 or more votes, they both survive
to Stage Two, which does become necessary to declare a winner.</p>
<h2>6) COUNTING STAGE TWO</h2>
<p>Again, we concentrate on one pair of options at a time. In Stage Two, we
compare each surviving option against each other surviving option. Any options
that failed to beat Status Quo by 12 or more votes in Stage One are ignored in
Stage Two. I would imagine that the two most common situations at this point
will be:</p>
<p>1) all the options (apart from Status Quo) reaching Stage Two</p>
<p>2) all the options apart from Re-Open Discussion (and Status Quo) reaching
Stage Two.</p>
<p>The technique for comparing options against each other in Stage Two is
exactly the same as in Stage One. Pick the possible pairs of competing options
out one at a time and compare only the preferences awarded in those two columns.</p>
<p>In our example, let us suppose Option A and Option B make it through to Stage
Two from the case above. Isolating those columns only,</p>
<table><tr><th>Name</th><th>A</th><th>B</th></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Jones</td><td>1</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Smith</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Brown</td><td>1</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Green</td><td>3</td><td>4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter White</td><td></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Black</td><td>1</td><td>3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Voter Robinson</td><td>-</td><td>-</td></tr></table>
<p>...and so on...</p>
<p>Voters Jones, Green and Black prefer Option A to Option B; voter Smith
prefers Option B to Option A; voters Brown, White and Robinson express no
preference between them. Continue in this vein for all the voters and come to a
conclusion that some number preferred Option A to Option B, and some number
preferred Option B to Option A. The Option out of these two which gained more
preferences is the winner of this pair; there is no minimum size of victory. It
is possible, but unlikely, for two Options to tie should exactly as many prefer
each over the other (ie 14 prefer Option A to Option B and 14 prefer Option B to
Option A).</p>
<p>You must proceed to declare a winner out of every possible pair of Options
that can be drawn from the Options surviving from Stage One.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you will reach a situation where one Option is the winner of every
pair of itself and any other surviving Option. This Option is your Condorcet
Winner. For instance, if only Option A and Option B in the example above
survived from Stage One, the winner of that pair would be the Condorcet Winner.
Another case might see Option A, Option B and Re-Open Discussion surviving from
Stage One, then the winner between Option A and Option B would also have to beat
Re-Open Discussion in order to be the Condorcet Winner. This extends further if
there are more than three Options surviving from Stage One.</p>
<p>The slightly conceptually scary thing about Condorcet is that it is possible
there will not be a Condorcet Winner. However, this does require an unusual set
of circumstances. Suppose, in a particular vote, Option B, Option D and Option E
(only) survive Stage One. Suppose that furthermore, Option B is the winner of
the Option B - Option D pair, Option E is the winner of the Option B - Option E
pair and Option D is the winner of the Option D - Option E pair. As we do not
have a single Option which is the winner of all the pairs of itself and the
other surviving Options, we do not have a Condorcet Winner. Technically, we have
a Condorcet Top Set of Option B, Option D and Option E. What happens in this
circumstance is that Re-Open Discussion wins, regardless of whether it reached
Stage Two or not (or even whether it appeared on the ballot paper or not).</p>
<p>It is also possible that two (or more!?) Options might tie against each
other, but both be the winners of all other pairs of themselves and all other
surviving Options. (For instance, Option A, Option B and Re-Open Discussion
might all survive to Stage Two; if Option A ties with Option B and both Options
A and B beat Re-Open Discussion, this situation would occur.) In this case, the
tie shall be resolved by lot. This would result in uk.*'s biggest ever coin-toss
- but that is a bridge we should cross only when we reach it.</p>
