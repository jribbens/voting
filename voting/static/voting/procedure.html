    <h2 id="startingout">Starting Out</h2> 
    <p>When you're ready to handle a vote, wait for the Co-Ordinator to send
      around the usual bleating mail to the mailing list asking for some
      volunteer to handle a vote because he has to put up shelves/work too
      hard/go yak herding in Patagonia.
    <p>Don't bite off more than you can chew on your first vote - unless you've
      been a proponent for a reorganization, your first vote should be a
      single-group non-controversial non-AV one.

    <h2 id="routinematters">Routine Matters</h2> 
    <p>If you have questions, ask on the UKVoting mailling list. But don't give
      away results in your questions.
    <p>If other members ask questions, keep them confidential if they pertain
      to votes in progress.
    <p>If a UKVoting member is the proponent, use caution. If you are that
      proponent, be on your best behavior.
    <p>Voting in a CFV you are running is highly frowned upon. It is best to
      just not do it. Believe me, it'll save you a lot more hassle than a
      single vote is worth!

    <h3 id="voteassign">Get the Vote assigned to you</h3> 
    <p>The coordinator will tell you that it has been assigned to you. This is
      the "passing of the baton." You should then get the proponent's latest RFD
      (which can be found in
      <a href="news:uk.net.news.announce">uk.net.news.announce</a>) and the
      <a href="template.txt">Template CFV</a>. At this point, the proposal
      becomes your responsibility and you have the corresponding authority as
      votetaker.

    <h3 id="contactproponent">Contact the Proponent</h3> 
    <p>Contact the proponent to notify them that you will be the votetaker for
      their proposal and that you are writing the CFV.
    <p>This can also be a good time to tell the proponent a few things like:
    <ul> 
      <li>Under no circumstances will information on the progress of the vote
        be available while voting is in progress. You may even tell them that,
        if such information were to get out, it would mean instant cancellation
        of the vote so they don't want that to happen.
      <li>They should refrain from campaigning and, instead, let real levels of
        interest drive voters. Proponent campaigning can cause a voter backlash
        and obtain the opposite result of that intended.
    </ul> 
    <p>Since you can't take a position on the proposal, you will refer any
      voters with questions or comments about its content to them.
     
    <h3 id="writecfv">Write the CFV</h3> 
      <p>Write the CFV based on the latest RFD.
      <p>Send a copy to the proponent for review.
     
    <h3 id="postcfv">Post the CFV</h3> 
    <p>When the proponent says the CFV is OK, send it to the
      uk.net.news.announce moderator at control@usenet.org.uk. The CFV
      including headers should be an attachment to a message which tells the
      moderator the name of the proposal if it's cross-posted to any moderated
      newsgroups (list them) where the places are that he needs to fill in
      dates (usually two: expires and voting deadline). This is followed by the
      headers and CFV such that the moderator can clip out the remaining lines
      in the message and post them.
     
    <h3 id="post2cfv">Post the 2nd CFV</h3> 
    <p>This should be done approximately halfway through the voting period. The
      subject should now start with "2nd CFV:".
    <hr> 
     
    <h2 id="resultprocs">Results Procedures</h2> 
    <p>Do not disclose results, even to the proponent, before they are posted
      in uk.net.news.announce. It's hard to know whether a proponent will be
      able to restrain themselves or how they'll tell others. When results time
      arrives, there is a possibility that many people will have an equal
      interest as the proponent in the results.
